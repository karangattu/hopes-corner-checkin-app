# Supabase Configuration (Optional - only needed for cloud sync)
# By default, the app uses localStorage only (recommended for development/testing)
# To enable cloud sync, configure these credentials AND toggle sync in the UI (Admin > System)
# When using proxy mode, these are stored securely in Firebase Functions
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Supabase Proxy Mode (Recommended for production)
# Set to 'true' to use Firebase Functions as a proxy (hides Supabase credentials from client)
# Set to 'false' or omit to use direct connection (credentials exposed on client)
VITE_USE_SUPABASE_PROXY=false

# Firebase Emulators (Development)
VITE_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=false

# Performance Optimization (Optional)
# Set to 'true' to disable IndexedDB persistence for maximum local performance
# Useful when testing with large datasets (33k+ records) or when running without Supabase
# Note: State will reset on page reload when persistence is disabled
# VITE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE=false

# Development Notes:
# - By default (DEV mode): Cloud sync is DISABLED even if Supabase is configured
# - This makes testing and batch uploads easier (no cloud sync delays)
# - Enable cloud sync via UI: Admin > System > Cloud Sync toggle
# - Production mode: Cloud sync is enabled by default if Supabase is configured
